## UX

### Goals

The goal of this website is to create a user submitted library of recipes that is unique and with a "non-commercial" feel. Clean and simple, users should feel like they are cooking 
recipes from their grandparents, parents, friends and people close to them. 

### Target audience goals

This website is catered for people who loves to cook recipes with a "local" feel regardless of age and gender.

User needs:
- Selection of unique, non-commercial and user submitted recipes.
- Be able to share their own recipe.
- Simple and clean design.
- Free from ads, blogs and other "clutter".
- Easy to navigate in any device.

How this website meets their needs:
- Users are able to submit their own recipe.
- Growing collection of user submitted recipes to choose from.
- Design is simple and clean but still visually appealing.
- No blogs , unneccessary clutter or ads.
- The design such as a fixed Navbar makes its very easy to navigate around.

### Goals as a developer
- Expand my portfolio.
- Practice my Python ,Database and Framework skills as well as refresh my HTML,CSS and JS skills.
- A communal online cookbook with a collection of unique and user submitted recipes.
- Increase users which will also grow the number of recipes available.

### User stores

As a user, what I would want in a recipe website:
1. Direct and easy way to get to the recipe I want.
2. A number of recipes to choose from.
3. Submit and contribute my own recipes.
4. For recipes to have that "home-made" feel.
5. Access the website from any device.

### Design choices

**Colour scheme**
- The initial colour design (refer to [**Wireframe**](#wireframes)) leaned towards a feminine feel so the colours were changed.
- The primary colours for this website are #fff , #51808B and different shades of grey. The colours are chosen because they are gender neutral 
so it caters to all users regardless of gender.
- The colour combination also presents a clean and simple looking website because the colours are not too "strong".

**Fonts**
- Intially, I used Pacifico:cursive for the header fonts. I decided to change the fonts as this was not reflective of my design goals.
- I'm using Poppins as my main font as this presents a much simpler and cleaner feel which is one of my design goals.

**Ease of use**
- Navbar is fixed at the top so users will always have access to the main/important pages.

**Recipes Page**
- Initial design was to display the available recipes (name and cooking time) in a collapsible accordion. The design was updated to cards as
the collapsible accordion simply did not allow me to provide enough information for the users browsing through the recipes page.
- Cards are nows used to display the available recipes as this allows me to display a lot more information to the user such as images, short description, prep time and etc.
- Cards also provide a cleaner and less cluttered look which reflects the "clean" look goal.
- Search bar added so users can quickly search recipes.

**Footer**
- Footer was added to the final design. The footer section allows me to put navlinks at the bottom of the page which will increase ease of use for users.
